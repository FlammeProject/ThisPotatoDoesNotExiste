 # ThisPotatoDoesNotExist

This project displays a random potato.

## Main Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays a random potato image.
- `images/`: The folder containing the potato images.

## How It Works

1. The `index.html` file contains a JavaScript script that randomly selects an image from those available in the `images` folder.
2. The selected image is then displayed on the web page.

## Usage

To see the project in action, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. A random potato image will be displayed each time the page is loaded.
